# Constant-current-load
Constant current load circuit with 0-2A adjustment

## Finding a design and adjusting it
TODO: Link to eevblog article comment, and my schematic with explanation...

## Prototype and testing
TODO: Breadboard, components, pictures, testing data, why 102 capacitor and why pot 39+47k...

## Additional components
TODO: Arduino + oled, fan, heatsink, external current setting

## Building it
TODO: Pictures of enclosure and layout, wiring, cooling, front and back panel design...

## Final results
TODO: Final pictures, another testing, overheating testing
